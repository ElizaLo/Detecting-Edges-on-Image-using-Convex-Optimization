# Edge Detecting of Reflections

## **Bachelor Research**

My Bachelor research work is based on pattern recognition and edge detection. The main idea of this method is to detect edges of reflections using convex optimization, namely **alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)** from a single image. 

Reflections could be can be of two types: reflections have almost monotone color or color around edges varies smoothly.

First of all I use Canny edge detector to a given color image with reflections to detect all edges on the picture. Next, we extract reflection edges from the initial edge image by solving a certain convex optimization problem. And Finally, the extracted image with edges is binarized by a simple thresholding operation. 

I tested this method on a large number of photos of cells made under a microscope and made sure that the proposed method works and it can be used in medicine
